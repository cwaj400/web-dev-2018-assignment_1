# Web Development Summer 2018 Course Website 

A simple application which allows students to register, login, see their profile, logout and gives
full editing admin privileges. I will add courses, classes and modules in due course. 

This simple program was built using the following technologies:

    • Client Side: HTML, JavaScript, CSS/Bootstrap for styling
    • Server Side: Java & SQL. Java uses RestFull API's and JPA (Java Persistance Library).
                   The User model is mapped to a SQL schema which tracks changes.
